# Fit - Track - App

FitTrack is an app designed to help users track their fitness journeys, activities, and goals. The application supports two types of users—Employees/Admins and Customers—each with specific roles that determine their permissions and access throughout the app. These roles define the user's authority over various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The backend of FitTrack is implemented as a RESTful API using C# and ASP.NET
